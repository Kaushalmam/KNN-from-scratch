# KNN-from-scratch

- This is an implementation of K- Nearest Neighbor Algorithm on the fundamental level.
- The dataset used for this implementation is taken from UCI machine learning repository.
- This is called the Iris data set. The dataset has attributes of three different types of flowers.
- Fundamentally the user will pass a value, k, and the classification process will happen with respect to the k nearest neighbors to the test point.
